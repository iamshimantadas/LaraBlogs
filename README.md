# LaraBlogs ~ Blog App ~ make ‚ù§ Laravel

This is a blog project with advanced features such as live search via AJAX calls, read posts, share posts directly to whatsapp, donation feature for a single post by visitor(razorpay gateway) etc. Admin can create categories, edit & delete them. Admin can make posts & edit after publistion. 
Admin able to see search histories, visitor's contact requests, next article requests by visitors etc.


Fully responsive app thanks to:
Admin Panel: https://github.com/xriley/portal-theme-bs5
Frontend Logbook theme fisher: https://themefisher.com/products/logbook

Note: for some technical reason Razorpay test/live key has been disabled. But don't worry you can paste your own live key into that and start accepting payments.
I have also applied google adsence into project which also disabled. But you can un-comment that and put your your script of display ads.
